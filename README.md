# FOPTiForest: Fast Optimal Isolation Forest with Parallelization for Anomaly Detection
This repository contains the code for the experiments of the paper "FOPTiForest: Fast Optimal Isolation Forest with Parallelization for Anomaly Detection".

# Requirement
- numpy==1.20.1
- sklearn==0.22.1
- pandas==1.4.1

# Dataset
We evaluate all methods on a large number of widely used benchmark datasets, which can be found on public repositories such as the UCI Machine Learning Repository, Kaggle Repository, and ADRepository.

# Experiment
### An example for running the code:
    python demo.py --dataset=ad --threshold=20 --branch=0 

#  Readability 
I will add some comments afterwards to enhance the readability of the code.
